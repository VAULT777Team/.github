# VAULT777

Vault777 is a fully on-chain, non-custodial casino built on Arbitrum. Every wager settles on chain after a verified Chainlink VRF proof, with no hidden servers, no custodial balances, and no adjustable odds. All game outcomes, payouts, fees, royalties, and program flows emit public on-chain receipts.

* Monthly staking with 80% of Treasury inflows distributed automatically

## Economics

* 1% to Treasury, 1% to Growth with the bankroll
* Creator royalty: 0.1% of handle per wager
* Treasury distributes 80% of inflows monthly to stakers
